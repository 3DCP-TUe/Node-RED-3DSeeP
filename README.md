# Node-RED 3DSeeP

General dashboard and data logger for the 3D concrete printer in the [Structures Laboratory](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-labs/structures-laboratory) at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/). 

## Dependencies

Node-RED

- [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) v3.1.9
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.13.0

Nodes:

- [node-red-contrib-boolean-logic-ultimate](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-boolean-logic-ultimate) v1.1.9
- [node-red-contrib-fs](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-fs) v1.4.1
- [node-red-contrib-moment](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-moment) v5.0.0
- [node-red-contrib-opcua](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-opcua) v0.2.328
- [node-red-contrib-throttle](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-throttle) v0.1.7
- [node-red-contrib-dashboard](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-dashboard) v3.6.5

## Version numbering

Node-RED-3DSeeP uses the following versioning scheme: 

```
0.x.x ---> MAJOR version: incompatible changes; for example, columns of the CSV file are removed or renamed. 
x.0.x ---> MINOR version: functionality added in a backward compatible manner; for example, columns are added to the CSV file. 
x.x.0 ---> PATCH version: small backward compatible changes; for example, the layout or controls on the dashboard were changed. 
```

Changes that change the data logger's CSV file result in at least a new minor release.
