# Analysis

This folder is intended to store analysis files. These files can include, for example, simple time series plots that provide quick insights into the data. Please also include the script used to generate each plot. This analysis script can serve as a starting point for others. To generate these files, you can use template scripts from `src/analysis`.

As an example, the folder can be structured as follows:

```
+-- analysis
|   |-- analysis.m
|   |-- lib.m
|   |-- pressure.pdf
|   |-- viscocity.pdf
|   |-- mortar_temperature.pdf
|   |-- ...
```
